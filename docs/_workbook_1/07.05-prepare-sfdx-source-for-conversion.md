* Creating a Package from Source against the DevHub

## Creating a Package using SFDX
Since you don't want to include profiles in your managed package, you'll need to get rid of them before converting your code back from SFDX source to MDAPI source.

**Step 1 of 2: Prepare for Packaging**
1. Verify that all package components are in the project directory where you want to create a package. If you’re trying out the exact steps and commands in this workflow, you must add at least one piece of metadata before you continue to the next step.
2. In the `sfdx-project.json` file, specify a namespace using the namespace attribute. `For example: “namespace”: “exp-mgr”`
3. If you specified a namespace when you created a Salesforce DX project in step one, you can skip this step. Before adding a namespace, make sure that you’ve linked the namespace to your Dev Hub org.

**Step 2 of 2: Create a Package**

1. Run the following command to create a package,
```sf package create --name "Expense Manager" --path force-app --package-type Unlocked```

You can change the type to either Managed or Unlocked depending on the type of Package you're creating.
"Expense Manager" is the name of the Package.

**NOTE:** After you create a package, you can’t change or add a namespace, or change the Dev Hub the package is associated with.
